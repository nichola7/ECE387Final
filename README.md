# ECE387Final
Final project for ECE387.
This project is dedicated to creating a Simon Says game with an arduino Uno, an HC-05 bluetooth chip, and various LEDs that come with an arduino kit. 
This project is useful for the understanding and implementation of the bluetooth HC-05 chip as well as the limitations of said chip, along with some limitations of the arduino uno.
Some great places to start with this project is to read up on the HC-05 chip and be familiar with how LEDs work with the arduino. Links to tutorials and projects that were particularly useful will be found in the wiki. Also knowing how to use the Serial functions will be useful as well as a basic understanding on how to code sequences would be helpful as well. 
There are many places to look for help on how the Bluetooth HC-05 Chip works and other arduino items used in this project. The most useful ones will be linked to and as much information will be given in this wiki on how the HC-05 does (and does not) work. This project is not maintained and improved upon after publication and many improvements have already been thought about but may never be implemented to this specific project.
